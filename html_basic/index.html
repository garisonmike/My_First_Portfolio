    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

    <p>
        This is my first project in the ALX HTML Basic module. I am learning how to structure
        an HTML document properly and use different tags to build a webpage.
    </p>

    <h2>About My Learning Journey</h2>

    <p>
        HTML is the foundation of all web development. Understanding how to use tags such as
        headings, paragraphs, images, and links is very important.
    </p>

    <h3>My Goals</h3>

    <p>
        By the end of this program, I want to be able to build complete, well-structured,
        and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
        I enjoy learning new technologies, and web development is opening many great
        opportunities for me.
